        <h1>Story</h1>
        There once was a woman who had a booth at the farmer's market. She would set up her booth every Saturday morning during the summer.
        She would sell African Violets and hand painted signs. Her son would come with her and help. As payment for his help he
        would get five whole dollars. He would go to the bakery booth "Old World Bakery" and wait for them to open. In the display case there were chocolate croissants, 
        bear claws and danishes but all the little boy ever wanted was a glazed fruit tart. Such a small treat would make this boy's day. He would return to his mother's booth
        with a big smile on his face and enjoy his treat in the sunshine. Sometimes the best things are the simple things.
